# glitchFXdev
is a repo for my undergrad thesis. I'll be developing visual effects for Adobe After Effects.

My intent is to develop a small suite of interesting and usefull effects, built around ideas of glitch art.
In my thesis text, I'll be describing commonly used effects, figuring out how they work and explaining my effects.
