# glitchFXdev
is a repo for my undergrad thesis. I'll be developing visual effects for Adobe After Effects.

Currently working on a customizable pixel rain effect.

My intent is to develop a small suite of interesting and useful effects, built around ideas of glitch art.
In my thesis text, I'll be describing commonly used effects, figuring out how they work and explaining my effects.

#### Folders
##### Code
Code for AE plugins. 
##### Text
Thesis text. I'll probably start by typing txt files and then edit them using Latex.
##### Auxilary
Overly fancy folder name for 'other' 

###### Who am I
Maj Smerkol, currently working on this ^.
